        <p>
          This disclaimer and the features 'cards.sort(() => Math.random() -
          0.5);' and 'matched' were developed with assistance from ChatGPT.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conceptualization of these features was done by Viktor Wiman, with
          ChatGPT providing implementation support.
        </p>
        <p>
          All other aspects of the website, including design and functionality,
          were independently developed by Viktor Wiman, utilizing official
          documentation where necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          The images used for the cards were initially generated with the help
          of ChatGPT and subsequently refined and edited using Adobe Express.
